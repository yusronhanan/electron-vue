# electron-vue

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run electron:serve
```

For this project, I cannot package it using electron-packager. There is some issue with the vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder itself.
But, I already make another project that you can install (.exe), here : https://github.com/yusronhanan/electron-vue

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
